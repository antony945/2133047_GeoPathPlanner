# Booklet: SCRUM Process

## Introduction

This project was developed using the SCRUM agile methodology using JIRA. We organized our work into two-week sprints, each with a specific goal. This approach allowed us to adapt to challenges and deliver value incrementally.

## Sprint 1: Foundation and Core Map Interaction

*   **Duration:** 2 Weeks (22/09/2025 -> 06/10/2025)
*   **Sprint Goal:** Build the overall architecture and define the project structure.
*   **User Stories:** [7, 8, 9] = 8 Story Points

## Sprint 2

*   **Duration:** 2 Weeks (13/10/2025 -> 27/10/2025)
*   **Sprint Goal:** Implement the routing and advance other microservices for integration.
*   **User Stories:** [1, 2, 3, 10, 14] = 23 Story Points

## Sprint 3

*   **Duration:** 2 Weeks (27/10/2025 -> 10/11/2025)
