# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:


GeoPathPlanner is a distributed web-application used to find the shortest path between a pair of geographical locations for an aerial (or sea) vehicle avoiding obstacles in a particular searching area. 
This will  be achieved implementing path planning algorithms such that RRT, RRT*, Bug Path and others.
The project architecture is designed to be distributed as a series of microservices. 
The front-end one could be a web application having a geojson.io-like map: interacting with it the user will be able to choose waypoints and obstacles (used as system input) in each of the following ways:
* manually select both the waypoints and the obstacles
* manually select waypoints using randomly generated obstacles
* loading waypoints and obstacles from a .geojson file
* loading some pre-defined sets of waypoints and obstacles (stored in a database)
In addition, the system provides various options to manage the routing request: for example, it could take into account the maximum turning rate of the drone or compare one route to the one that would use a ground vehicle or some other algorithm-based parameters. 
Finally, the system computes the optimal route.
Each routing request’s computation is important to be independent and parallel to the others in order to exploit the distributed nature of it and to optimize the resources.
So after each request, the system can scale up or down in order to balance the computational load on it


# USER STORIES:


1)  As a visitor, I want to try the app without creating an account so that I can quickly see how it works.
2)  As a user, I want to set points on a map where my drone should go so that I can get a possible route.
3)  As a user, I want to mark areas that the drone should avoid so that I can plan a safe path.
4)  As a user, I want to have options to customize which route to compute so to choose tradeoff between computation speed and quality of resulted route.
5)  As a user, I want to see the proposed drone route displayed on the map so that I understand how the drone would fly.
6)  As a user, I want to download or share the proposed route so that I can reuse it outside the app.
7)  As a visitor, I want to sign up into the application so that I can create my personal account to manage my data and routes.
8)  As a registered user, I want to log in to my personal space so that I can manage my routes.
9)  As a registered user, I want to log out to my personal account so that anyone can use my account.
10)  As a registered user, I want to edit my profile information.
11)  As a user, I want to see a clear explanation when no route can be found so that I understand what went wrong.
12)  As a user, I want to easily repeat my last request so that I can test it again.
13)  As a user, I want the option to adjust my inputs and try again after completing or failing request si I don’t have to start from scratch.
14)  As a user, I want the app to generate random no-fly areas so that I can quickly test different scenarios without having to draw them manually.
15)  As a user, I want the app to provide a easy way to clean the window so that I can easily restart over.
16)  As a registered user, I want to see a history of my past routes so that I can review or reuse them later.
17)  As a registered user, I want to delete past routes from my history so that I can no longer see routes that I don't want anymore.
18)  As a user, I want to load waypoints and constraints from geojson file, so that I can easily perform request without having to manually define it.
